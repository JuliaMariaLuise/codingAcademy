## Calendar Event Manager  
A dynamic calendar application that allows users to view, manage, and interact with events. This project provides a seamless interface for tracking dates, adding events, and viewing event details.  

---

## Features  
- **Interactive Calendar**: Navigate through months, highlight important dates, and mark the current day.  
- **Event Management**: Add, view, and delete events directly on the calendar.  
- **Event Details View**: Display all events grouped by month in a detailed and sorted format.  
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Events persist across page reloads for a better user experience.
